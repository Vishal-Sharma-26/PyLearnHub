PyMongo is the official Python driver for MongoDB, a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
It allows Python developers to interact with MongoDB databases, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations,
and manage collections and documents efficiently.

Key Features of PyMongo:-

1) Connection: Connect to MongoDB servers (local or remote) using a connection string or client instance.
2) Document Management: Insert, query, update, and delete documents in MongoDB collections.
3) Querying: Supports rich queries with filters, sorting, and projections.
4) Aggregation: Perform complex data processing using MongoDBâ€™s aggregation pipeline.
5) Indexes: Create and manage indexes to optimize query performance.
6) GridFS: Handle large files by storing them in chunks in MongoDB.

To install PyMongo, use pip:-
pip install pymongo

Common Use Cases:-

1) Web Applications: Store and retrieve user data, sessions, or content.
2) Data Analysis: Query and aggregate data for analytics or reporting.
3) IoT: Store time-series or sensor data.
4) Prototyping: Quickly build applications with flexible schema-less data.

Tips:-

1) Connection Strings: For remote MongoDB instances (e.g., MongoDB Atlas), use a connection string like mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<dbname>.
2) Error Handling: Always include try-except blocks for production code to handle connection failures or query errors.
3) Indexes: Use create_index() to improve query performance on frequently searched fields.
4) BSON: PyMongo uses BSON (Binary JSON) for data interchange, supporting Python data types like datetime and ObjectId.
