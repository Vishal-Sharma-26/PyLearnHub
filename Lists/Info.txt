A list is a built-in data structure that is ordered, mutable, and can store a collection of items (elements) of different data types.
Lists are one of the most versatile and commonly used data structures in Python. Below is a comprehensive overview of lists, covering
their key concepts, operations, and use cases, tailored to complement your previous question about generators.

Key Characteristics:
1) Ordered: Elements maintain their insertion order (accessible by index).
2) Mutable: You can change elements, add new ones, or remove existing ones.
3) Heterogeneous: Can store different data types.
4) Dynamic: Lists can grow or shrink in size as needed.
5) Indexable: Elements are accessed using zero-based indices (e.g., my_list[0]).
6) Iterable: Lists can be iterated over using loops or other iteration methods.
