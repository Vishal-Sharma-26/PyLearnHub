A loop is a programming construct that repeats a block of code multiple times until a specific condition is met. It helps reduce repetition and automate tasks.
There are two types of loops:

Loop Type	         Used When	                               Example

for	                 You know how many times to loop	       Loop over list, range, string
while	             You loop until a condition is false	   Loop until user input is valid

For Loop - A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
           With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

While Loop - With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.



Loop Control Statements:

Statement	                Description

break	                    Stops the loop immediately
continue	                Skips current iteration, goes to next
pass	                    Does nothing (placeholder)
